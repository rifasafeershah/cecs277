	 * This factory builds Geometric objects of the points family,

	 * more than an array of points.  The alternative to that style is the 
	 * point/dimensions style.  Both styles of Geometric object accept an array
	 * of points for the constructor, what they do with them behind the scenes
	 * is where the magic happens.
	 * 
	 * You might notice that this has no constructor and no instance variables,
	 * so this could have been done as a static class just as easily.
